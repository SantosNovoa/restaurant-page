# Whiskers & Brews 🐾☕ - Cat Café Restaurant Page

This is a simple restaurant webpage built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.  
It was my first project using **npm** and **Webpack** to bundle JavaScript modules.

## Features

- Fully modular JavaScript (separate files for Home, Menu, Contact)
- Webpack used for bundling assets and managing dependencies
- Dynamic DOM manipulation (page content loaded with JS)
- Cute cat-themed café design
- Responsive layout and simple styling

## Built With

- JavaScript (ES6 modules)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Webpack
- npm

## Project Structure

```
/src
  ├── contact.js
  ├── home.js
  ├── index.js
  ├── menu.js
  ├── styles.css
  └── assets/
      ├── cat.jpg
      ├── cafe.jpg
      └── cat-hs-1.jpg (etc.)

/dist
  └── (auto-generated by Webpack)
webpack.config.js
package.json
README.md
```

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/whiskers-and-brews.git
cd whiskers-and-brews
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the Webpack dev server:

```bash
npm run start
```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Lessons Learned

- How to set up and configure **Webpack** manually
- Using **modules** to organize JavaScript code
- Building a **single-page app (SPA)** without using a framework
- The importance of clean file structure and separation of concerns
